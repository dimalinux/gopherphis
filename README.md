While some wallets may get left behind when Monero switches to the Seraphis
protocol and Jamtis addressing, this new wallet written in pure Go will be
ready and support Seraphis on day 1 when Monero switches.

Seraphis is still a couple years away and evolving, but we'll track the
changes and use the time to develop a solid wallet.
