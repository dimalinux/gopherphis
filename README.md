While some wallets may get left behind when Monero switches to the Seraphis
protocol and Jamtis addressing, this new wallet written in pure Go will be ready
and support Seraphis on day 1 when Monero switches. Seraphis is still a couple
years away and evolving, but we'll track the changes and use the time to develop
a solid wallet.

Besides a wallet, the individual packages of this project are created and
documented so as to be general purpose Go libraries when working on Monero
related projects in Go.
